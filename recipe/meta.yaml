  summary: A fast tracking code for plasma accelerators

  description: |
    Wake-T (Wakefield particle Tracker) is a tracking code for laser- and
    beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators which aims at providing a fast
    alternative to Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. Instead of relying on
    the computationally-expensive PIC algorithm for simulating the plasma
    wakefields and the beam evolution, Wake-T uses a Runge-Kutta solver to
    track the evolution of the beam electrons in the wakefields, which, at
    the same time, are computed from reduced models.
